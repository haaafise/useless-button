# useless-button
A completely pointless, yet mildly entertaining button. Click it. It rotates. The background changes. That's it. That’s the whole thing.

# 🌀 Useless Button 🎯

## Basic Details

### Name: Muhammed Hafiz Tm

### Project Description

A button that spins and changes the background color with every click.
That's literally all it does. Seriously.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Ever felt like buttons don’t do enough *useless* things?
We fixed that. Too many buttons have *purpose* — it's exhausting.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We built a button that **does absolutely nothing meaningful**.
It spins. It flashes colors. It sparks joy... or confusion.
